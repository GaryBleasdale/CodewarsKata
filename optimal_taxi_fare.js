// Optimal Taxi Fare


// The student needs to get on a train that leaves from the station D kilometres away in T minutes.

// She can get a taxi that drives at V1 km/h for the price of R â‚¬/km or she can walk at V2 km/h for free.

// A correct solution will be a function that returns the minimum price she needs to pay the taxi driver or the string "Won't make it!".

// All the inputs will be positive integers, the output has to be a string containing a number with two decimal places - or "Won't make it!" if that is the case.

// It won't take her any time to get on the taxi or the train.

// In non-trivial cases you need to combine walking and riding the taxi so that she makes it, but pays as little as possible.
